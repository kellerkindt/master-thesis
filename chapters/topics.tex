\chapter{Outcome and further work}

In this chapter the main concerns are listed.
For each concern the current progress is described as well as further work that needs to be done.

\section{Storage}

One of the central concerns is the storage management.
The program needs to make input files available on each execution node an collect the results once the computation is complete.
There are a few main architectural strategies to approach this.
Simplified, either at a centralized location which is accessed by all execution nodes, a copy of the input files all execution nodes or distributed between all execution nodes with a set redundancy.
The advantages and disadvantages can depend on the specific implementation and is therefore discussed in combination of such (see \autoref{state_of_the_art}).

Further testing is required to decide whether a more complex storage system is required, or the simplicity of a centralized solution outweighs the setup and maintenance overhead.

\section{Coordination}

Another important concern is the coordination of the nodes.
A central coordinator with external server nodes, such as GitLab and Jenkins have, might not be sufficient for more complex and longer lasting pipelines.
The probability that the master would need to be offline while there is a stage executed is in the scenario of this implementation a lot higher than for GitLab or Jenkins, because the stage is being execution for hours or days.
Coupling stage execution plans on node availability in beforehand, as well as recovering from a sudden master failure implies additional implementation complexity.
Completely decentralizing the coordination does this as well and even more, but also allows the usage of the system while the master failed or is unreachable due to maintenance.
With further prototyping and research a reasonable solution shall be found.

\section{Binary distribution}

In a time where containers are common and have proven to be usable, the installation of the binaries directly on the operating system they are executed shall be avoided.
There shall be no manual, nor automatic but custom file copies of the binaries or images from one server to the other.
Experience shows, that without a proper management, this can easily become a mess, in which it is no longer clear, which file / image belongs to which version.
At the same time, making all binaries publicly available through the Docker Hub\cite{docker:hub} is no option either.
Whether a self hosted Docker Registry\cite{docker:registry} could be the solution to this will be determined in further testing.

\section{User Interface}

Providing a useful user interface might not be important to the functionality of the system itself but for the user experience.
A bad user experience will cause a system not to be used.
It became common practice for a rich user experience to be web based and supported by JavaScript.
For a potentially decentralized system, it is also advantageous to be able to access a disconnected node in the same manner as the remaining system, which further encourages a web based solution.
Web based solutions such as React and Angular shall therefore be investigated for being used as user interface.
