\chapter{Further work}

In the scope of this thesis a system was implemented to distribute the workload of a computer vision pipeline onto several compute nodes.
Automatically stage scheduling improves the utilization of available hardware - especially at times where the staff is absent, like at nights or weekends.

Adding the support for WebSockets could help to make the Web-Application more responsive to serve side changes, like a stage state change.
Pushing desktop notifications to the client or e-mail messages could reduce the response time of the staff for when a stage failed or a project needs attention otherwise.
GlusterFs could be investigated for whether its (site) replication could reduce the usage of network bandwidth.

A system like this provides an endless stream of ideas to further improve the user experience or for extensions and capabilities to add.
