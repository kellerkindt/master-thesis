\chapter{Conclusion}

Overall the project was a success.
Winslow helps to improve the efficient usage of available hardware resources by scheduling work in times, where no staff is watching.
It helps in keeping order by separating projects and workspaces.
The user interface provides an interaction method that is easy to understand for users, and provides upload and download mechanism without resorting back to console commands.

In the implementation phase an interesting and minimalistic way to synchronize events based on a commonly shared directory was discovered and implemented.
Winslow is easy to setup and due to its few dependencies \todo{nomad, and kinda spring+angular} easy to maintain.
Its architecture allows to be extended in further work.
