%A short summary of what the project is about.

This thesis if about implementing a distributed system to process large work items with specialized hardware requirements
Docker containers are used to deploy the system and for job isolation.
It furthermore assists the user by organizing the work items into projects, tracking execution progress and monitoring hardware utilization.
All this is reported to the user in an Angular Web-Application which also allows the user to customize the execution pipeline, inspect intermediate results and to actively manage stage executions.
The decentralized system detects and recovers from node failures and uses elections to select the target node for job executions.
%Easy setup and extendability is the focus for dependency and architecture evaluation.
It is focused on easy setup and extendability.
